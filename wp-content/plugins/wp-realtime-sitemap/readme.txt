== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I would like to make a donation how can I do this? =

You can make a [Pay Pal donation](http://www.daniel-tweedy.co.uk/redir/wordpress-plugins-donation/ "PayPal donation") by clicking [here](http://www.daniel-tweedy.co.uk/redir/wordpress-plugins-donation/ "PayPal donation"), your [donation](http://www.daniel-tweedy.co.uk/redir/wordpress-plugins-donation/ "PayPal donation") will be very gratefully received thank you!

= Do I need to add the &lt;!--wp-realtime-sitemap--&gt; to a Post or a Page? =

This method is no longer supported, please use the shortcode instead.

= Is there a php code so I can add it to a php template file? =

This method is no longer supported, please use the shortcode instead.

= What should I call the page that I add the sitemap to? =

You can call it whatever you like. I would suggest you call it Site Map.

= I have some pages that I need but are to be hidden and not on the sitemap =

My plugin only shows posts and pages that have the status as published, so if you wish to have a post of page be published but not to be shown, change its status to "privately published" and it will disappear off the sitemap, you can do this easily when editing a post/page with the Publish box on the left hand side, I have included a screeshot to show what to set this box to.  You can also exclude by ID now in the settings.

= I cant get the other short code options to work only the show one now works =

This has been removed in the latest version due to the options in the admin interface being very complex and is easier to choose how you want it to be sorted here, the shortcode is now only used to be able to sort the options differently.

== Screenshots ==

1. Settings page in the admin area.
2. Output as displayed on Twenty Ten theme.
3. How to hide a post and/or page off the sitemap using the published privately option in WordPress.

== Examples ==

The shortcode will still use the database, this will be the default options now so you can use a small shortcode in your page and not have to put a long line just to get what you want, you can however do this if you wish to change the default options.

Show pages: `[wp-realtime-sitemap show="pages"]`.

Show posts: `[wp-realtime-sitemap show="posts"]`.

Show custom post types: `[wp-realtime-sitemap show="customposts"]`.

Show archives: `[wp-realtime-sitemap show="archives"]`.

Show categories: `[wp-realtime-sitemap show="categories"]`.

Show tags: `[wp-realtime-sitemap show="tags"]`.

Show everything (fixed order of: pages, posts, custom post types, archives, categories, tags): `[wp-realtime-sitemap show="all"]`.

== Translations ==

If you're multi-lingual then you may want to consider donating a translation, WordPress is available in several different languages, see http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_in_Your_Language for more information.

Currently translated into the following languages :-

* Brazilian Portuguese *needs updating* - kindly done by Gervasio Antonio.
* Czech *needs updating* - kindly done by Libor Cerny.
* Russian *needs updating* - kindly done by [ssvictors](http://wordpress.org/support/profile/ssvictors).

All translators will have a link to their website placed on the plugin homepage on my site, and on the wordpress plugin homepage, in addition to being an individual supporter.
